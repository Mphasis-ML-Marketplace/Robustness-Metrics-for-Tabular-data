# Robustness Metrics for Tabular data

## Product Overview

This solution measures the key robustness measures for the Keras based tabular data classification model. Robust models are immune to the adversarial attacks, thus measuring robustness of the models is important from the point of view of data and information security. This solution leverages four metrics that reflects robustness of the model.

## Product Highlight 

* Machine learning model run with a risk of adversarial attacks which can compromise model effectiveness and/or data and information security. The solution simulates these attacks to measure the robustness of the model. Here in this solution, Fastest Gradient Sign Method(FGSM) has been used to measure four robustness metrics that explain the immunity of the model to the adversarial attacks.
* Solution provides four metrics as output. 1. Empirical robustness 2. Loss sensitivity 3. CLEVER Score 4. Difference in accuracy. These four metrics gives the broad overview about the robustness of the model and sensitivity of the  Keras classifier to the adversarial attacks.
* PACE - ML is Mphasis Framework and Methodology for end-to-end machine learning development and deployment. PACE-ML enables organizations to improve the quality & reliability of the machine learning solutions in production and helps automate, scale, and monitor them.
